A pipe system between cheminformatic chat channels and let people be where they want to be :). 


## Architecture

- As this is still a Proof of concept (POC) i'll be using the software known as "matterbridge". A way of linking chat systems together that is open source. The first pipe will be between slack and discord. 

| Channel       | Slack | Discord | Gitter | Discourse |
|---------------|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| General       | TBD   | TBD     | TBD    | TBD       |
| Introductions | TBD   | TBD     | TBD    | TBD       |
|               |       |         |        |           |
