A pipe system between cheminformatic chat channels

Hello! And welcome to the interface of the sewer of the pipe system connecting cheminformatic channels Found below in this README you will find badges associated with
different channels for different packages linking them all together. This was inspired by a tweet that got the most attention i've ever got so lets see where this project goes.


I'll be using matterbridge to start linking systems together and perhaps azure to set up more projects

## Architecture

- As this is still a Proof of concept (POC) i'll be using the software known as "matterbridge". A way of linking chat systems together that is open source. The first pipe will be between slack and discord.
